# MEMO  
## Multilingual Critical Translation Mode (CN–EN–HU)  
**Project:** Novira  
**Status:** Deferred Strategic Direction  
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  

---

## 0. Activation Gate (Strict Condition)

This development direction may only be activated if the system has already:

1. Successfully translated at least **one complete Hungarian public domain short story**.
2. Demonstrated stable block-based translation.
3. Produced consistent terminology across long-form text.
4. Generated structured notes.
5. Delivered clean export (DOCX/MD).
6. Maintained transparent audit history.

Until these conditions are met, this initiative is **not allowed to enter planning or development phase**.

---

## 1. Purpose

To extend Novira into a **multi-source critical translation system**, capable of:

- Handling original source text (e.g. Classical Chinese).
- Integrating a secondary reference translation (e.g. English).
- Producing an independent Hungarian literary translation.
- Documenting interpretive decisions transparently.

This is not simple translation.  
This is a **digital critical workshop mode**.

---

## 2. Strategic Rationale

This mode:

- Strengthens fidelity without sacrificing readability.
- Aligns with Novira’s core promise: *Readable with fidelity.*
- Positions Novira as a curatorial literary system.
- Enables complex classical works to be processed responsibly.

This is a differentiation feature — not an MVP feature.

---

## 3. Conceptual Model

Each text block may contain three layers:

- **Source A** — Original text (e.g. Chinese)
- **Source B** — Reference translation (e.g. English)
- **Target** — Hungarian translation (independent output)

Important:

The Hungarian version is not a mechanical retranslation of English.  
The English layer functions as interpretive support only.

---

## 4. Required System Extensions (Future)

When activated, the following modules will likely be required:

- Multi-source block schema
- Terminology memory system
- Entity locking (characters, places, doctrinal terms)
- Cross-block context memory
- Verse-mode translation handling
- Note-source attribution system
- Three-column parallel reading UI

---

## 5. Cost Reality

Primary complexity increase is in:

- Data modeling
- Context orchestration
- Consistency control
- UX design for parallel view

Token usage is secondary.  
Architecture and quality control are the main cost drivers.

Complexity level: **Medium → High**

---

## 6. Phased Implementation Plan (If Activated)

### Phase 1  
English → Hungarian translation  
Original stored as passive reference.

### Phase 2  
Terminology memory integration.

### Phase 3  
True multi-source contextual translation (CN + EN active context).

---

## 7. Appropriate Use Cases

- Classical Chinese literature
- Sanskrit religious texts
- Ancient Greek / Latin works
- Philosophical and doctrinal literature
- Annotated critical editions

---

## 8. Not Intended For

- Marketing copy
- Fast content generation
- Light contemporary prose
- Non-layered narrative texts

---

## 9. Strategic Classification

This is a:

- Long-term capability
- Prestige feature
- Academic-grade differentiation layer

Not part of MVP.  
Not part of early scaling.

---

## 10. Governance Rule

Before activation:

A formal review must confirm that Novira’s baseline translation engine has proven stability on at least one full Hungarian public domain novella.

Only after that milestone may this memo be moved from **Deferred** to **Planning** state.
