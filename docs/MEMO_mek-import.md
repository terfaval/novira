# MEMO -- MEK Import Positioning

## Context

During evaluation of MEK available formats (Word, EPUB, HTML, PDF, RTF,
XML), it was determined that EPUB import is not required for MVP.

The system can rely on HTML or RTF as structured inputs and normalize
internally.

## Strategic Position

The core value is not format ingestion complexity.\
The core value is:

-   Controlled legal source
-   Traceable provenance
-   Clean canonical internal representation
-   Reliable export (MD/DOCX)

MEK already provides structured formats. Therefore:

> Import simplicity \> Format completeness (Stage 0 priority)

## Implementation Philosophy

-   Source trust is more important than format diversity.
-   Canonical internal representation is the true system backbone.
-   Export flexibility comes after internal stability.

## Brand Alignment

This reinforces:

-   Transparency
-   Curated input
-   Institutional reliability
-   Editorial discipline
