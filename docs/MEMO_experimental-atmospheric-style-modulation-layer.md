Experimental Atmospheric Style Modulation Layer (EASML)

Project: Novira / Műfordító
Status: Experimental – Lab Layer
Stage: Post-MVP (After Stable Translation Engine)

0. Activation Gate

This module may only be activated if:

Canonical block ingestion is stable.

At least one full novella translation has been completed end-to-end.

Terminology consistency is demonstrably stable across 10k+ tokens.

ALPAD (pre-translation analytical layer) is operational or functionally equivalent.

Until these are met, this layer remains experimental and inactive.

1. Purpose

Define a controlled atmospheric modulation layer that allows stylistic re-voicing of a translated text without altering:

Plot

Character roles

Narrative perspective

Structural events

This is not adaptation.
This is tonal reparameterization.

It exists as a literary laboratory tool.

2. Conceptual Positioning

Baseline translation engine goal:
Readable with fidelity.

Atmospheric modulation goal:
Readable with controlled aesthetic shift.

The modulation layer operates after translation, never before canonical storage.

Pipeline:

Import → Canonical Blocks → (Optional) ALPAD → Translation → Atmospheric Modulation → Export Variant

The original translated version remains untouched.

3. Modulation Architecture

The system does not offer fixed “genres”.

It offers intensity-controlled atmospheric vectors.

Example structure:

{
lexical_density_shift: 0–100,
sentence_compaction: 0–100,
regional_texture: 0–100,
tonal_gravity: 0–100,
irony_suppression: 0–100,
metaphor_amplification: 0–100
}

Preset profiles are compositions of these vectors.

4. Example Preset: Frontier / “Dumpling Eastern” Mode

Conceptual inspiration:
Spaghetti Western dryness + Eastern European moral landscape.

Target effects:

Lexical register:

Fewer ornamental clauses

More concrete nouns

Physical environment emphasis

Reduced abstract commentary

Sentence structure:

Shorter declarative units

Reduced subordination

Increased pause rhythm

Dialogue:

Compression

Omitted explicit emotional labeling

Implied tension

Narrative tone:

Elevated moral gravity

Dry irony

Reduced lyrical excess

Intensity levels:

Level 1 (Subtle)

Mild lexical tightening

Slight reduction in ornamentation

Level 2 (Visible)

Noticeable compression

Sharper tonal contrast

Level 3 (Strong stylization)

High concision

Stark imagery

Frontier-like narrative cadence

Hard constraint:
No event-level modification allowed.

5. Safeguards

The system must:

Preserve character names and roles.

Preserve event sequence.

Preserve narrative POV.

Log modulation parameters in export metadata.

Mark export as “Experimental Variant”.

No silent overwrite of base translation permitted.

6. Governance Rule

Any new atmospheric preset requires:

Formal memo update

DECISIONS.md entry

Validation on one public domain novella

Comparative diff against base translation

No aesthetic drift allowed without documentation.

7. Strategic Value

This layer:

Enables screenplay experimentation.

Enables tonal comparative studies.

Supports creative workshops.

Differentiates Novira from standard translation tools.

It is not commercial MVP functionality.
It is a prestige laboratory layer.

END OF MEMO

Most “dumpling eastern” novella candidate:

Mikszáth Kálmán – A néhai bárány

Why:

Rural moral landscape

Irony already present

Strong community dynamics

Symbolic object (the lamb)

Dry humor that can be compressed into frontier-style gravity

Alternatively (even stronger frontier texture):

Móricz Zsigmond – Tragédia

Why this might be perfect:

Stark rural environment

Harsh moral economy

Physical hardship

Short form

Already near-minimalist → ideal for tonal hardening

If you want maximum “Eastern frontier” atmosphere:
Móricz is stronger.

If you want ironic moral western:
Mikszáth is more elastic.
